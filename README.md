# Purpose
My professor recommended me to find a project outside
of class to work on, so I chose freeCodeCamp.org's course
on building a game engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025QFeZfeyM

After each segment I go over what was coded to make sure I'm understanding it
and not just typing it.

This project has introduced me to gradle, OpenGL, GLSL,
and working on larger projects (outside of single-class programming assignments for class).
